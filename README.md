## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourGithubUsername/my-flask-blog.git
    cd my-flask-blog

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

    Then activate it:

    - For Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - For macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3. **Install Required Packages:**

```bash
python app.py
