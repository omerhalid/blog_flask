## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourGithubUsername/my-flask-blog.git
    cd my-flask-blog
    ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

    Then, activate the virtual environment:

    - For Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - For macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3. **Install the Required Packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *Note: The `requirements.txt` file should list all necessary dependencies, including Flask and any libraries required for API integration.*

## Running the Application

To run the application after the setup:

```bash
python app.py

## API Configuration

Ensure that you have the API keys configured for:

- Weather data service
- Financial data service

API keys should be stored in environment variables or a configuration file that is not tracked by version control to maintain security.

To utilize the finance section:

1. Navigate to the `/finance` endpoint.
2. Use the provided search functionality to query stock data by ticker symbol.
